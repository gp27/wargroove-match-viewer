# Wargroove Match Viewer (Alpha)

## Current features


## Planned features / fixes

### UI
- General improvements on the UI (now everything is very ugly and it usually just put there to see if everything is working properly)
- Better controls for zoom / map drag (Scrooling is curently always centered on the top left corner, which forces the user to readjust the view most of the time)
- Automatic camera movement during moves navigation

### Graphs
- Trades value tracker

### Moves
- Display info about the current move (units involed, trade value etc)
- Easier navigation between moves with keyboard, autoplay or other methods
- Moves displayed as a tree instead of a list with the possibility to hide/show all moves inside a turn

### Units
- Highlight unit on the map by clicking in the unit list and viceversa
- Display unit move/attack range on click
- Unit moves history and total trades value
- Groove aura indicator
- Option to change unit colors

### Structures
- Show recruit options

## What about the map tilset/sprites
There are a number of reasons, for which I won't be able to implement a nicer view of the maps / terrains
